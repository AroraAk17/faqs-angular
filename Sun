I am Akarshi Arora, a graduate from IGDTUW, Delhi, with a keen interest in research work. I feel honored that one of my review papers was selected for presentation at an esteemed IEEE Scopus conference. I also had the privilege of interning at Adobe, where I worked on Acrobat search.

Apart from my academic and professional pursuits, I am a cricket enthusiast and actively participate in a corporate cricket team. I am also passionate about public speaking and love taking part in such opportunities.

Always eager to learn something new, I am incredibly excited to be a part of the shadowing program and look forward to the knowledge-sharing journey with all of you.

Thank you for this wonderful opportunity
